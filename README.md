# Driftinn
**Anonymous-first friendship for college students.**

> "Find real friends, not profiles."

## 🚀 Elevator Pitch
Driftin helps college students form genuine friendships by matching anonymous, campus-verified peers based on personality signals (MBTI), shared interests, and conversational intent — then safely revealing identities only when both people agree.

## 📖 About Driftin
Driftin is a campus-first app that makes it easier to meet real friends without the pressure of photos or quick judgments. Students create a light anonymous profile (MBTI + interests + intent), match with peers from the same college, chat anonymously for a short period, and mutually reveal identities only when both agree.

College is the time to build friendships that matter — but social media, group chats, and surface-level scrolling often make it hard to meet people who actually click with you. Driftin solves that by flipping the script: it prioritizes personality and conversation over photos and follower counts.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Campus-verified sign-up**: Secure verification via college email or phone OTP.
- **Anonymous-first matching**: Match based on specific interests, MBTI personality signals, and friendship intent tags.
- **Text-only anonymous chat**: No images or files pre-reveal to encourage honest conversation and remove pressure.
- **Reveal-on-consent**: Identities (names, photos, social links) are revealed *only* when both users accept.
- **Strict Safety**: 
    - Clear rejection policy (single-sided rejects close the match).
    - Block & report tools.
    - Automated moderation and admin review queues.
- **Post-reveal features**: Media sharing, voice notes, contact sharing, and meet suggestions unlock after the reveal.

## 🔄 How it Works
1. **Sign Up**: Register with your college email or phone and verify your student status.
2. **Profile Setup**: Complete a brief MBTI-style quiz, pick your interests, and define what kind of friend you're looking for.
3. **Start Drift**: Tap "Start Drift" to enter the matching pool. We find compatible, nearby students.
4. **Chat**: Begin an anonymous, text-only conversation. Use prompts and icebreakers to spark real talk.
5. **Reveal (or Drift Away)**: After the chat meets a threshold (time or message count), either user can request a reveal.
    - **Mutual Yes**: Profiles unlock!
    - **One No**: The match is closed, and anonymous content is archived/removed.

## 🛡️ Safety & Privacy
- **Verified Students Only**: We ensure everyone on the platform is a verified student.
- **Text-Only First**: Reduces abuse risk during the anonymous phase.
- **Server-Enforced Reveal**: Clients cannot force a reveal; it strictly requires mutual consent log on the server.
- **Moderation**: Built-in automated moderation plus human review for flagged content.
- **Data Privacy**: Anonymous messages are subject to retention policies to control data lifespan.

## 💡 Why it Matters
Driftin reduces social friction and the performative bias of photo-first apps, making it quicker and safer for students to find friends who actually fit their interests and conversational style. It turns campus anonymity into a tool for authenticity — not for hiding — by giving students a pressure-free space to discover real connections and reveal only when they’re ready.
