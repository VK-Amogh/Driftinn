# Driftinn 🚀
> *Redefining Social Discovery for the Academic World.*

---

## 📖 Introduction
**Driftinn** is not just another social media app; it is a specialized **social discovery ecosystem** engineered exclusively for the university landscape. In an era of digital noise, Driftinn cuts through the clutter by providing a **verified, secure, and hyper-localized** platform where students can connect, collaborate, and create memories with peers who share their campus, interests, and academic journey.

We are building the digital layer of the college experience—bridging the gap between "online friends" and "real-world connections."

## 🎯 The Core Problem
Modern social networks are vast but impersonal. College students face a unique paradox:
- **Identity Crisis**: It's hard to verify if someone is *actually* a student at your university on broad platforms.
- **Fragmented Community**: Campus life is siloed. Engineering students rarely meet Art majors unless they cross paths by accident.
- **Safety Concerns**: Meeting strangers from the internet carries inherent risks.

## 💡 The Driftinn Solution
Driftinn offers a gated community where **trust is the baseline**.
1.  **Establish Trust**: Every user is verified via their `.edu` institutional email. No bots, no outsiders.
2.  **Foster Connection**: Our proprietary "Vibe Match" algorithm connects students not just by major, but by hobbies, music taste, and "drift" (current mood).
3.  **Encourage Action**: The app is designed to move you *offline*. From study groups to weekend hikes, Driftinn helps you find your crew.

## ✨ Detailed Feature Breakdown

### 🔐 1. Fortress Verification System
- **Institutional Auth**: We utilize a direct integration with university email servers to ensure 100% student authenticity.
- **Dynamic OTP**: A secure, time-sensitive One-Time Password system prevents unauthorized access.
- **Anti-Profile**: A unique approach to profiles that focuses on *personality first*, reducing superficial judgment.

### 🤝 2. Intelligent Social Graph
- **Department Tagging**: Automatically groups students by their field of study (e.g., Computer Science, Literature).
- **Interest Bubbles**: Users select micro-interests (e.g., "Late Night Coding", "Indie Rock", "Varsity Football") to find exact matches.
- **The "Drift"**: A real-time status update that lets others know what you’re up to (e.g., "Studying at the Library", "Looking for Lunch").

### 💬 3. Secure Real-Time Communication
- **Instant Messaging**: Low-latency chat infrastructure powered by real-time database technology.
- **Privacy Controls**: Users have granular control over who can message them (e.g., "Only Seniors", "Only Verified Matches").
- **Ephemeral Content**: Options for messages that disappear after viewing, encouraging candid conversation.

## 🛠️ Engineering Architecture

### Local Flutter setup

The app imports `lib/firebase_options.dart`, which is intentionally ignored by Git. Before running it from a fresh clone, copy the checked-in development template into place:

```powershell
Copy-Item driftinn_mobile/lib/firebase_options_temp.txt driftinn_mobile/lib/firebase_options.dart
cd driftinn_mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

The template contains client-side Firebase project identifiers. Configure your own Firebase and Supabase projects for a separate deployment. The social graph and matching algorithm remain roadmap items.
Driftinn is built on a robust, scalable stack designed for performance and security.

### **Client-Side (The App)**
- **Framework**: **Flutter** (Dart). Delivers native performance on both iOS and Android from a single codebase.
- **State Management**: **Riverpod**. Ensures reactive, testable, and maintainable application state.
- **Design System**: A custom-built UI library implementing "Glassmorphism" and modern motion design.

### **Server-Side (The Brain)**
- **Platform**: **Google Firebase**.
- **Authentication**: Custom Claims & Phone/Email Multi-Factor Authentication.
- **Database**: **Cloud Firestore** (NoSQL) for flexible, real-time data syncing.
- **Logic**: **Cloud Functions** (Node.js) to handle heavy lifting (matching algorithms, sanitization) securely away from the client.

### **Security & Compliance**
- **Data Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest.
- **GDPR/CCPA**: Built with privacy-first principles, allowing users full ownership and deletion rights of their data.
